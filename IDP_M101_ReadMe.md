## Code Commenting
We have decided upon minimal code commenting, as this is industry standard for ensuring high quality code. Comments in code are frequently over-used, and due to the lack of compile-time checking they are frequently incorrect, and even when correct they quickly fall out of date becoming incorrect and misleading.

The standard now is to write code with well-named and descriptive variables, functions, etc. and to write methods that are short, clean, and simple, such that they are easily readable and understandable without comments. It is important to comment code where this is not achievable, but the simpler and clearer the code is the less likely it is to contain bugs, whereas over-commenting spreads misinformation and confusion an hence increases the frequency of bugs.

Ideally the code would be further documented by a suite of clean and well written automated tests, but this was not possible in the timeframe.

Please email me (ajb363@cam.ac.uk) if you have any questions regarding modern industry code commenting and documentation standards, I would be happy to share upon my many years of experience as a senior medical embedded technical & project lead.
